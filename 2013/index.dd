  $(T h1,,DConf 2013)

  $(T h2,,We invite you to DConf 2013, the conference of the D programming language (Menlo Park, CA, May 1-3 2013).)

  $(P The D programming language is undergoing rapid growth, spurred
  by a bustling talented community and downright furious coding
  activity on the open-source $(LINK2
  http://github.com/dlang/dmd, compiler
  front-end) and $(LINK2
  http://github.com/dlang/phobos, standard
  library). These also fuel the $(LINK2 http://gdcproject.org,
  gdc) compiler (based off of the $(LINK2 http://gcc.gnu.org,
  gcc) infrastructure) and the $(LINK2
  https://github.com/ldc-developers, ldc) compiler (grown atop of
  the $(LINK2 http://llvm.org, llvm) infrastructure). A conference to
  catalyze the community was just bound to happen, and indeed we have
  successfully funded $(LINK2
  http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2083649206/the-d-programming-language-conference-2013-0,
  DConf 2013) via Kickstarter.)

  $(P DConf is the main face-to-face event for everyone and everything
