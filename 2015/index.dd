$(T h1,,DConf 2015 Registration is open!)

$(T h2,,Please join us at DConf 2015, the conference of the D programming language at Utah Valley University in Orem, UT, May 27-29 2015.)

$(P We are thrilled to benefit of the generous hosting of Utah Valley University's Computer Science Department at its beautiful campus. $(HTTP uvu.edu/cs, UVU/CS) has an excellent track record of preparing students for real-world software engineering jobs, and has been a long-time supporter of D by teaching it to its students. Special thanks are due Department Chair $(HTTP uvu.edu/profpages/profiles/show/user_id/67, Chuck Allison).)

$(P The D programming language has continued to grow through 2014, undergoing a $(HTTP erdani.com/d/downloads.daily.png, three-fold increase) of $(HTTP dlang.org/download.html, dmd) daily downloads from the main site. Quality and
stability have improved all across the board for $(LINK2 http://github.com/D
-Programming-Language/dmd, dmd), $(LINK2 http://gdcproject.org, gdc), $(LINK2
https://github.com/ldc-developers, ldc), and the $(LINK2 http://github.com/D
-Programming-Language/phobos, standard library).)

$(P DConf is the main face-to-face event for everyone and everything related to
the D language and environment. Utah Valley University will host the conference at its campus in Orem, UT. We aim at making this next edition even bigger, better, and badder than DConf 2014!)

$(T h2,,Schedule Highlights)

$(P Take a look at our $(LINK schedule) for topics that include language evolution, practice, and experience reports. Our speakers are a balanced collection of established and up-and-coming experts.)

$(P Want to tune in to the language's strategic vision and direction? Tune into $(TALK bright, Walter Bright)'s and $(TALK alexandrescu, Andrei Alexandrescu)'s keynotes. Core contributor $(TALK murphy, Daniel Murphy) will discuss automatic conversion of C++ code to D for achieving D compiler bootstrapping.)

$(P Hate garbage? So do we! Release czar and all-around D guru $(TALK nowak, Martin Nowak) has recently worked on dramatic improvements of D's garbage collector, which he will share, along with tips and tricks for better memory performance, in his talk.)

$(P Don't miss experience reports from using D in varied domains such as $(TALK zvibel, large-scale storage systems), $(TALK smith, hedge funds), $(TALK isaacson, database drivers), $(TALK colvin, scientific computing), $(TALK allison, teaching at university level), and $(TALK gubler, learning).)

$(P What's the deal with them ranges everybody talks about? Glad you asked! Listen to D veteran contributor $(TALK davis, Jonathan M. Davis) is up for an introduction. Also learn about $(TALK ruppe, dynamic types) and $(TALK wakeling, random number generation).)

An assortment of talks featuring topics such as $(TALK schott, tooling), $(TALK nadlinger, runtime support), $(TALK sechet, memory hierarchy), $(TALK strasuns, porting large codebases), and $(TALK neves, behavior-driven development) complete a strong program.)
